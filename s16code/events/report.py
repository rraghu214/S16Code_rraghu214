"""The artifact a human reads after the agent ran without them.

A live SSE stream is for a screen somebody is watching. Nobody was watching. The
deliverable of an unattended night is therefore a written account that can be
read once, in order, and acted on: what arrived, what was ignored and why, what
was done, what it cost, what was refused, and what is still waiting for a person.

Two of those sections are the ones usually missing. **What was ignored** is most
of the night and is the only evidence that the relevance gate is calibrated.
**What was refused** is the work a control prevented, which leaves no other
trace: without it an operator sees an untouched budget and concludes nothing ever
threatened it.

The report also states its own liveness, because a report full of zeroes means
either a quiet night or a dead watcher, and those must not look the same.
